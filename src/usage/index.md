# Using Pi Relay

Once Pi Relay is running, you don't have to do anything! Since you have an e-paper display, you can check in on its activity to see how much bandwidth you've donated.

## Automatic Updates

One of the tricky things about operating a relay is keeping it up-to-date. We handle this for you by automatically updating your device. You'll be able to see the Tor version on the diaplay to confirm it's working.

## Flags

At first, you'll notice "No flags yet." After it's running for some time flags like "Running," "Valid," "Stable," or "Fast" will begin to display. 

## Bar Chart

You'll see a bar chart visualizing your bandwidth contributions relative to your monthly quota. Your display refreshes every minute, so you always know your most recent activity.
